# Meeting Schedule Template 

**Annual Calendar** <br> 
Establishing a full year calendar helps everyone to plan more effectively.

1. Determine dates and location for each meeting for the next 12 months.  Presenter and coach may be assigned monthly or quarterly, depending on how often your Forum reviews the parking lot.
2. If your Forum is uncomfortable setting dates 12 months in advance, strive for a 6 month calendar, then add one month to the end at each monthly meeting.
3. Define the process for rescheduling a meeting.
