A: Since each group member takes responsibility for their own community experience, we encourage individuals to speak up if you have an issue.

Here are three effective ways to own and enhance your Forum community experience: 
 
1. Say: “Time out, I have an issue with…” specifying a behavior within the group with which you would like to see shifted.
2. A group member who realizes that discussions have become less than effective - superficial, overly confrontational, dominated by a few loud voices and not making space for others rather, etc - takes the risk of sharing their assessment and asks the group to discuss and align on a path forward.
3. A group moderator or leader can end each meeting by asking each member to take a minute to share what individuals liked and disliked about the meeting. This not only assures that all members’ opinions are heard, but it also gives the group an opportunity to iterate.
