## Forum Ground Rules 
In order to create an environment that fosters authenticity, confidence, and trust, we suggest following three “rules” that will help you create an authentic bonding experience with your Squad Members.


| GROUND RULE | DETAILS | 
| --- | --- | 
| Confidentiality | - What’s said in the Forum stays in the forum. <br> - Trust is needed before openness and vulnerability can occur. <br> - Building trust creates a safe environment. <br> - Complete disclosure only occurs when complete confidentiality is assured.
| Gestalt Language | - Speak only from experience. <br> - Use “I” statements, not “you” statements. <br> - Speak in past tense. <br> - Avoid “should”, “would”, and “could” |
| Participation | **Giving / Receiving Value** <br> - You get what you put in. <br> - Every member is an equal contributor. <br> **Handling Issues** <br> - Let everyone know that they should bring up concerns immediately. <br> - If anyone is not happy with the structure of the Forum or an individual contributor, they should bring up their concern to you. <br> **Commitment** <br> - Hold members accountable to show up.
